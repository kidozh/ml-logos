Machine Learning Logos
======================

This repository hosts SVG vector versions of various ML library logos for convenience.

The logos are or may be trademarks of their respective owners.

Aside from the NumPy and Pytorch logos, the logos were hand-vectorized from raster sources with utmost love and caring.
